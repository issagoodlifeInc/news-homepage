## My process

1. Started with writing up all the html having decided on how to best handle the layout given
   
2. Styled the page from top to bottom switching between mobile and largew screen sizes as I styled the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Some code I'm proud of :- 

- Adding the tob and bottom border for the second news item only
```css
.news :nth-child(3) {
  border-block: 1px solid var(--darkgrayishblue);
}
```

### Continued development

Better turnaround time
Better and cleaner html markup set up
Navigation handling
